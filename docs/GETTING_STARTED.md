Welcome! This guide will get you up and running with the AI-Go-To-Market-Engine in minutes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **1. Clone & Setup**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ace-Hsu/AI-Go-To-Market-Engine.git
cd AI-Go-To-Market-Engine
```

### **2. Configure API Access**

# Edit config.json with your Anthropic API key
# Replace "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual key
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Navigate to any agent directory
cd agents/message_house_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Run Your First Agent**
```bash
python scripts/generate_simple.py
```

## üéØ Your First Complete Pipeline Run

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Strategic Input** 
**‚ö° CRITICAL:** This is the most important step that determines your entire output quality.

1. Navigate to `examples/12_questions_template.md` 
2. Copy the strategic questions template to create your own Q&A file
3. Fill in your strategic answers with deep business conviction - these become the PRE-SYSTEM foundation that drives all 8-10 marketing assets

**Why This Matters:** The AI agents can only be as strategic as the human expert input you provide. Quality strategic answers = quality marketing assets.

### **Step 2: Run the Complete Pipeline**

**Option A: Manual Execution (Learn the System)**
```bash
# Start with strategic foundation
cd agents/message_house_agent
python scripts/generate_simple.py

# Continue with persona development
cd ../user_story_agent  
python scripts/generate_simple.py

# Run gap analysis
cd ../gap_analysis_agent
python scripts/generate_simple.py
```

**Option B: Automated Pipeline (Enterprise Mode)**
```bash
# Full automated execution
cd agents/agent_0b_orchestrator
python scripts/run_pipeline_phase1.py
# (Evaluate keywords quality gate)
python scripts/run_pipeline_phase2.py
```

- Input files go in `1_input/{project_name}/`
- Generated assets appear in `3_unlabeled/{project_name}/`
